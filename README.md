CDK for Audioniek's Duckbox Development Toolchain

IMPORTANT NOTICE:

As of May 1st, 2017 this git is no longer maintained in favour of the buildsystem-git.

This git will eventually disappear in the last quarter of 2017. Please note that this will mean that it is no longer possible to build Tvheadend for SH4 using one of my git's.
If you want to continue using this git, either fork it or use a copy for your own use locally.

The reason for this is that maintaining three git's for the same purpose is a bit too much for a single person.

Thank you for understanding.
